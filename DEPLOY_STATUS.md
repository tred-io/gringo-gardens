# Deployment Status

## Issue
Vercel consistently serves old CSS hash `index-SM9PXeaH.css` despite multiple rebuilds generating new hashes like `index-BNg9n-l9.css`.

## Attempts Made
1. Multiple clean rebuilds
2. Modified vercel.json configuration
3. Added timestamp-based asset naming
4. Changed build command structure

## Current Build
- Generated at: $(date)
- Local assets: $(ls public/assets/*.css public/assets/*.js 2>/dev/null || echo "No assets found")
- Vercel serving: Still old hashes

## Next Steps
Need to investigate Vercel deployment cache or build process issues.
