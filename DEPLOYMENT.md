## Deployment Steps

### 1. Connect to Vercel
1. Push your code to GitHub repository
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
3. Click "New Project" and import your GitHub repository

### 2. Configure Build Settings
Vercel will automatically detect your build configuration from `vercel.json`:
- **Framework Preset**: Other
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (auto-detected)
- **Output Directory**: `dist/public` (configured in vercel.json)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (auto-detected)

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
For Google Analytics tracking, add in Vercel dashboard:
- `VITE_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`: Your Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID (starts with "G-")

### 4. Deploy
Click "Deploy" - your site will be live at `your-project-name.vercel.app`

## What Works in Production

### ✅ Fully Functional Features
- **Complete website navigation** - All pages load without errors
- **Product catalog** - Browse native plants and categories  
- **Gallery** - View beautiful plant photography
- **Blog** - Read gardening articles and tips

- **Mobile responsive** - Perfect on all devices
- **SEO optimized** - Ready for search engines
- **Google Analytics** - Track visitor behavior (if configured)

### ⚠️ Admin Features (Development Only)
- **Admin dashboard**: Available at `/admin` with password "GringoGardens2025!"
- **Content management**: Works in development environment only
- **Database operations**: Requires backend server (not included in static build)

## Production Limitations

Since this deploys as a static site on Vercel:
- Contact form submissions are stored in browser local storage (not persistent)
- Admin dashboard shows "backend required" message
- No database connectivity for dynamic content updates

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Test your live site** at your Vercel URL
2. **Configure custom domain** in Vercel dashboard (optional)
3. **Set up Google Analytics** if you haven't already
4. **Test contact form** and other interactive features
5. **Verify mobile responsiveness** on actual devices

## Support for Dynamic Features

If you need full admin functionality and database features in production:
1. Consider using Vercel's serverless functions
2. Set up external database (like Neon PostgreSQL)
3. Or deploy to a platform that supports full-stack applications

Your site is ready to go live! The static version provides an excellent user experience for visitors browsing your plant catalog and learning about your nursery.
