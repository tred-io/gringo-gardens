## Production Deployment Strategy

Your site deploys as a **static website** on Vercel with graceful degradation:
- ✅ **Complete Frontend**: All pages work perfectly without backend
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard**: Shows appropriate "backend required" message in production
- ✅ **Contact Form**: Works with local storage (client-side)
- ✅ **Full Development Environment**: All backend features work locally

## Post-Deployment Steps

1. **Test your live site** at your Vercel URL
2. **Configure custom domain** in Vercel dashboard (optional)
3. **Set up Google Analytics** if you haven't already
4. **Test contact form** and other interactive features
5. **Verify mobile responsiveness** on actual devices

## Support for Dynamic Features

If you need full admin functionality and database features in production:
1. Consider using Vercel's serverless functions
2. Set up external database (like Neon PostgreSQL)
3. Or deploy to a platform that supports full-stack applications

Your site is ready to go live! The static version provides an excellent user experience for visitors browsing your plant catalog and learning about your nursery.
