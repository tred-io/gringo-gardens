# Gringo Gardens - Texas Native Plant Nursery

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for Gringo Gardens, a Texas native plant nursery based in Lampasas. The application serves as both a public-facing website showcasing native plants, trees, and nursery services, and an admin dashboard for content management. Built with a modern tech stack focusing on performance, user experience, and mobile-first design with a bluebonnet-inspired theme.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Frontend Architecture**: React SPA with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool. The client follows a component-based architecture with shadcn/ui components for consistent design. Uses Wouter for lightweight routing and TanStack Query for server state management.

**Backend Architecture**: Express.js REST API server with TypeScript. Uses a middleware-based approach with proper error handling and logging. Integrates Replit's authentication system for admin access.

**Build System**: Vite for frontend development with hot reload, esbuild for production server bundling. Supports both development and production environments with proper asset handling.

Uses sessionStorage for authentication state within browser session.
- **Category Homepage Selection System**: Added `showOnHomepage` boolean field to categories table with admin interface controls. Home page now filters and displays only categories marked for homepage display (max 4). Admin dashboard shows "Homepage" badges for selected categories and provides toggle switch in category edit form.

System automatically analyzes images and extracts comprehensive botanical information including common name, scientific name, hardiness zone, sun preference, drought tolerance, Texas native status, indoor/outdoor classification, and detailed descriptions. Enhanced admin dashboard with plant details display and manual identification triggers. Added database schema extensions to store all plant metadata. **Major Update**: Implemented binary data approach using base64 encoding to support object storage images without requiring public URLs - system now fetches image data directly and converts to base64 for OpenAI API, eliminating URL accessibility limitations. Removed all technical references from admin interface - system seamlessly updates main gallery fields (title, description, category) with identified plant information.
