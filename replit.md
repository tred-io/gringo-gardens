# Gringo Gardens - Texas Native Plant Nursery

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for Gringo Gardens, a Texas native plant nursery based in Lampasas. The application serves as both a public-facing website showcasing native plants, trees, and nursery services, and an admin dashboard for content management. The project aims to provide a performant, user-friendly, and mobile-first experience with a bluebonnet-inspired theme. Key capabilities include dynamic content management for products, blog posts, and galleries, robust authentication for administrators, and integration of AI-powered plant identification for gallery images and product creation.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

**Frontend Architecture**: React SPA with TypeScript, built using Vite. It employs a component-based approach with shadcn/ui for consistent design, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS, customized to a bluebonnet theme. Forms utilize React Hook Form with Zod validation. The design is responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

**Backend Architecture**: Express.js REST API server with TypeScript. It features a middleware-based approach with robust error handling and logging. The system includes a comprehensive database schema managed by Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL dialect) on Neon serverless PostgreSQL, covering users, products, categories, blog posts, gallery images, reviews, contact messages, and newsletter subscribers. Authentication is a simple password-based protection system for admin access, with session management using PostgreSQL-based storage. Full CRUD operations are available for all content types, including image handling for various media.

**Key Features**:
- **Content Management**: Full CRUD operations for all content, including dynamic home page categories and comprehensive gallery management with tagging, filtering, and duplicate prevention.
- **Plant Identification**: Integration with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for automatic plant identification from uploaded gallery images, extracting botanical details and populating product fields.
- **Business Operations**: Management of business hours, contact messages, and newsletter subscribers.
- **SEO & Analytics**: Comprehensive Google Analytics 4 integration and SEO optimization with dynamic meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards, and JSON-LD structured data.

## Recent Changes (August 2025)

**CSS Configuration Resolution (August 17, 2025)**: Completely resolved local/Vercel styling inconsistencies.
- **Problem**: Local development showed broken styling while Vercel displayed correctly due to configuration conflicts
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting Tailwind configs between root and client directories, causing inconsistent build behavior
- **Solution**: Created delegation config system where root `tailwind.config.ts` delegates to `client/tailwind.config.ts`
- **Key Fixes**: Updated content paths to work from both directories, simplified PostCSS config, removed .vercelignore exclusions
- **Status**: Both local and Vercel now generate consistent 70KB CSS files with full bluebonnet theme
- **Result**: Reliable styling with bluebonnet blue (#004bac), Texas green (#7ed856), and earth tones across all environments

**Build System Resolution**: Completely resolved all import resolution issues that were causing Vercel deployment failures.
- **Problem**: Recurring build failures due to incompatible alias imports (`@/...` and `@assets/...`) throughout the codebase
- **Solution**: Systematically converted all alias imports to relative imports across entire application
- **Status**: Build consistently successful (487KB bundle, ~8-10s), ready for reliable Vercel deployment
- **Components Fixed**: All pages (Home, Blog, Gallery, Products, Contact, About), all critical UI components, all asset references
- **TypeScript**: All LSP diagnostics resolved, proper type checking restored
- **Deployment**: Configured for Vercel with file-based API routing, static build optimization, and comprehensive import resolution fixes for reliable builds.

**Object Storage & Image Processing (August 18, 2025)**: Implemented advanced image optimization and multi-platform storage support.
- **AI Image Optimization**: Created Sharp-based image processor with 768px max dimension and 75% quality for AI plant identification, reducing OpenAI token usage by up to 80%
- **Multi-Size Processing**: Built comprehensive image processor generating AI-optimized, thumbnail, and lightbox versions for optimal performance
- **Vercel Blob Integration**: Added full Vercel Blob storage support with multi-size image processing and automatic optimization
- **Dual Storage System**: Replit object storage for development, Vercel Blob for production deployment - seamless environment detection
- **API Coverage**: Complete API endpoints for both storage systems with automatic fallbacks and error handling
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - File upload functionality confirmed working in both environments: Replit object storage (development) with full image processing, Vercel Blob (production) with direct upload and AI compatibility
- **Database Fix**: Resolved PostgreSQL text[] array handling for gallery image tags - fixed "column is of type text[] but expression is of type jsonb" error in Vercel deployment
- **Upload Flow Fix**: Implemented custom Uppy response handler to properly extract blob URLs from Vercel API JSON responses
- **Backend Validation**: Added API validation to reject upload endpoint URLs and ensure only proper blob storage URLs are accepted
- **Gallery Upload Complete (August 18, 2025)**: Fully resolved gallery image upload functionality across both environments
  - **Root Issue**: Uppy's AwsS3 plugin strips query parameters and overwrites custom metadata
  - **Solution**: Global window storage workaround to preserve objectName across Uppy's limitations
  - **Environment-Aware APIs**: Implemented dual API calls detecting Vercel vs local environments with appropriate endpoints
  - **Vercel**: `PUT /api/gallery-images` with `imageURL` field
  - **Local**: `POST /api/admin/gallery` with `imageUrl` field
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Gallery uploads working in both Replit development and Vercel production environments

**Complete API Unification (August 18, 2025)**: Eliminated dual API system complexity by unifying all admin endpoints
  - **Approach**: Each endpoint handles all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in single file using query parameters
  - **Unified Endpoints**: All admin operations use `/api/admin/resource?id=:id` pattern instead of REST-style URLs
  - **Database Integration**: All endpoints now connect to PostgreSQL database instead of returning static data
  - **Complete Coverage**: Products, categories, blog, reviews, gallery, contact, settings, team, newsletter subscribers
  - **Plant Identification**: Full AI integration with OpenAI GPT-4o-mini directly in unified gallery endpoint
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All admin CRUD operations work identically in Replit development and Vercel production

**Public-Admin API Alignment (August 18, 2025)**: Unified all public endpoints to match admin database connectivity
  - **Problem**: Public APIs were returning static data while admin APIs were database-connected, causing inconsistencies
  - **Solution**: Updated all public endpoints (`/api/products`, `/api/categories`, `/api/reviews`, `/api/contact`, `/api/blog`, `/api/gallery`) to connect to PostgreSQL
  - **New Public Endpoints**: Created `/api/blog`, `/api/gallery`, and `/api/newsletter` for frontend functionality
  - **Data Consistency**: Main website now shows real database content matching what admins manage
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Zero static data remaining, full public-admin alignment achieved

**Vercel Production Database Schema Fix (August 18, 2025)**: Resolved critical 500 errors in production deployment
  - **Problem**: All API endpoints failing in Vercel with "column does not exist" errors, returning HTML instead of JSON
  - **Root Cause**: Database schema column name mismatches between API expectations and actual PostgreSQL structure
  - **Schema Fixes Applied**:
    - Products: `stock_quantity` → `stock`
    - Team members: `display_order` → `"order"` (quoted SQL keyword)  
    - Settings: `created_at` → `updated_at` (column didn't exist)
    - Contact: `name` → `first_name || ' ' || last_name` (proper field mapping)
  - **Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All API endpoints now match actual database schema, Vercel production fully functional
